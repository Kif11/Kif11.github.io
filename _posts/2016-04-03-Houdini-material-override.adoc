= Houdini material override

:hp-tags: houdini, rendering, material, override, shaders, python

Overriding materials in Houdini  not a simple task that you might think.
There are many ways to do so such as Takes or
**shop_surfacepath** method mention here
(http://forums.odforce.net/topic/13385-global-material-override/) Python
Filtering technic described in the same post by King Tapir work pretty
well and do not required that all of your material assigned on the
object level. However, it might be difficult to figure out how to use it
for the first time. Made a .py file. In my case it called filter.py and
contain following code.

....
import mantra

def filterInstance() :
    mantra.setproperty('object:surface', 'op:/shop/AO'.split())
    mantra.setproperty('object:overridedetail', 1)

print "Python Filter Finished"
....

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|`filterInstance()` |Called just prior to the `ray_end` statement which
locks off the settings for an instance object. The function can
query `object:` settings and possibly alter them.

|`object:surface = ('')` |The surface shader attached to the object.

|`vm_overridedetail / object:overridedetail = ('false')` |When geometry
has shaders defined on a per-primitive basis, this parameter will
override these shaders and use only the object’s shader. This is useful
when performing matte shading on objects. Not supported for
per-primitive material assignment (material SOP).

|`'op:/shop/AO'` |Shop material that we going to override
|=======================================================================

Tell mantra to use this file as a Python Filter

Also, don't forget to force writing of all shaders into .idf by setting
Declare All SHOPs.

Create a simple SHOP material in this case I'm doing very simple Ambient
Occlusion shader.

If everything set correctly you should see the print output "Python
Filter Finished" in your console.
